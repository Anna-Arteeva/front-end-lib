            Currenly <strong>BEM</strong> is one of the most used frontend methodologies.

            Check out the
            <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/">official website</a>
            for more information.

        <h4>
            Key concepts
        </h4>
        <p>
            By BEM approach an application consists of re-usable <b>Blocks</b>, that includes <b>Elements</b> and both
            of them can have <b>Modifiers</b> to change the appearence of blocks or elements without creating a new
            entity.
        </p>

        <h5 class="m-t-3">Block</h5>
        <p>
            – a logically and functionally independent page component.
        </p>
        <p>
            Blocks can be nested inside any other blocks.

        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a head block can include a logo (logo), a search form (search), and an authorization block
            (auth).
        </p>

        <p>
            Blocks can be moved around on a page, moved between pages or projects.
            The implementation of blocks as independent entities makes it possible to change
            their position on the page and ensures their proper functioning and appearance.

        <h5 class="m-t-3">Element</h5>
        <p>
            – a constituent part of a block that can't be used outside of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a menu item is not used outside of the context of a menu block, therefore it is an element.
        </p>

        <h5 class="m-t-3">Modifier</h5>
        <p>
            – a BEM entity that defines the appearance and behavior of a block or an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of modifiers is optional.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, the appearance of the menu block (menu) may change depending on a modifier that is used on it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Modifiers can be changed in runtime (for example, as a reaction to a DOM event of the block), or via other
            blocks.

        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if the wrong credentials are entered when a user clicks the Sign In button (the 'click' DOM
            event), the 'visible' modifier is set on a hidden block with error messages.
        </p>

        <h5 class="m-t-3">BEM tree</h5>
        <p>
            Let's consider an example of a DOM tree:
        </p>

        <div class="block-code-large">
            <p>
                header
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-2">
                ├─logo
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-2">
                └─search-form
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-3">
                ├─input
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-3">
                └─button
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-2">
                └─lang-switcher
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-3">
                └─lang-switcher__item
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-3 m-l-2">
                └─lang-switcher__link
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-3">
                └─lang-switcher__item lang-switcher__item--modifier
            </p>
            <p class="p-l-3 m-l-2">
                └─lang-switcher__link
            </p>
        </div>
